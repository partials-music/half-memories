this song is about not being able to connect to people, even when you seem similar to them on the surface. even if sometimes you feel disconnected from everyone around you, you don't have to change.

Two Memories
Half-Brothers (i.e., Death and Sleep)
Half Memories

no lighthouse tonight in your eyes
no land bridge to cross your mind
shallow the sea shared with me
  sea but not deep shared with me
though you're death and I think I'm sleep
  though you're death and I think I'm sleep

no passage between us to take
no silence to navigate
and no ship our resemblance could meet
to slip from my memory

---

I can't seem to think I am right // what if this is a reference to some kind of prophetic dreams?

you're greater but I carry dreams
one day but two memories

together we climb inside
one night spent between the red teeth
but two different memories

we each find our way inside
his viscera warm and bright

it's dark in the heart of this beast
this perilous land we tread
this perilous air we breathe
thick with the power of dreams

like snow that you can't quite breathe
you're breath but I need to breathe
I can't seem to think I am right

bread but not blood shared with me

I can't see the fire for the flies
I can't feel my feet in the tide
I can't seem to think I was right

I don't want to see what I see

tonight, is there light in my eyes?

don't breathe on me, don't breathe on me

I don't want to see what I see

tonight, is there light in my eyes?

don't breathe on me, don't breathe on me

close your eyes

though no monster guards the way
though no three-headed beast bars the way
though no thorns grow across the way
and no road for our kinship to meet
and no road that our love could just meet
and no road our connection could meet
and no road that our blood could just meet


no silence when you come to play
no echoes except my name
no sadness when I have to leave
one day but two memories

whenever you bell players wade
through the water to call my name
we meet down among the reeds
one time but two memories

together we climb inside
one night spent between the red teeth
but two different memories

it's dark in the heart of this beast
this perilous land we tread
this perilous air we breathe
thick with the power of dreams

it's dark when I open my eyes
trepidatious here in the trees
together we enter inside
we each find our way inside
his viscera warm and bright
one day but two memories
like snow that you can't quite breathe
you're breath but I need to breathe
I can't seem to think I am right
you're greater but I carry dreams
our distance reminds me of brine
and conjures the taste of time
I can't seem to think I am right

divergence
a small anomaly
convergence
don't disconnect
/now that's enough
/just reconnect

with them I don't see what you see
my people are all around
I try to believe I was right

- bread but not blood shared with me
- only bread shared between you and me
- no blood shared between you and me
- night but not day shared with me
- sea but not shore shared with me

sleep close to me, sleep close to me
silences, one at a time
forgot myselves one at a time
from what was said when you came by
the things that I felt at the time
while you're out walking the night
the color of our last goodbye
I can't see the fire for the flies
I can't feel my feet in the tide
I can't seem to think I was right
I'm leaving my people behind



tonight, the older light is in your eyes
and it's hard to feel your feet beneath the tide
your intellect may sway you
from your [calling][purpose] or betray you
set the arguments aside

---

there may come a day when
outstay
delay
obey
outweigh
portray
dismay

grace
displace

[5] now the world can be an unfair place at times
[5] but your lows will have their complement of highs
[3+] and if anyone should cheat you, 
[4+] take advantage of, or beat you
[5] raise your head and wear your wounds with pride

now kid, I know I haven't been a perfect man
and I've avoided doing things I know I can
but if I've learned one thing to tattoo on my arm
or burn into my thumb 
it would be that

you must 
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done

old max schmelling was a formidable foe
the ambling alp was too, at least that's what I'm told
but if you learn one thing you learned it well
in june you must give fascists hell
they'll run but they can't hide

you must
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
[x2]

and when those thunder cloud are crying in the skies, in the skies
and when those fireflies keep shining lights in your eyes
keep your mind on the time 
with your ass on the line
keep your fleet feet sliding to the side, to the side

now the world can be an unfair place at times
but your lows will have their complement of highs
and if anyone should cheat you, take 
advantage of, or beat you
raise your head and wear your wounds with pride

you must
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done

stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
stick up for yourself son
never mind what anybody else done
